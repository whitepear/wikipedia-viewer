This application is live at: https://whitepear.github.io/projects/frontend/wikipedia/app/index.html

This application allows users to enter search terms and receive a list of Wikipedia articles related to the term(s) provided. A drop-down list of relevant autocomplete options will appear beneath the search bar as the user types. Users can also click a button to receive a random Wikipedia article.

This application is responsively-designed and consumes JSON data from the Wikipedia API. Autocompletion suggestions are debounced based on user-input, in order to optimise both performance and user experience.
